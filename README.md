# Very Simple JavaScript Image Gallery

This is a very simple, lightweith and standalone image gallery developped in JavaScript with JQuery.

# Why another image gallery in JavaScript ?

I had to install a lightweight image gallery on a USB key. The gallery had to run without any internet connection. Moreover I wanted to be absolutly sure of the behaviour of the programme: displaying images whatever their size and no more!

I conclued I will spend less time in developing my own image gallery instead of reviewing existing ones.
